        <p>Interviews for software engineering positions are equal measures normal job
interview and extemporaneous logic bomb de-arming with an audience. Most developers
know the drill; you stand up in front of one of more senior developers and have
to write code on a whiteboard to solve what’s normally a fairly academic toy
problem, the likes of which you have not thought about since college, what with
being busy writing real code for real problems.</p>

<h1 id="the-whiteboard">The Whiteboard</h1>

<p>Having given countless interviews myself over the last 10 years, I have noticed
that a non-negligible percentage of candidates simply lock up when faced with the
prospect of whiteboard coding. Many don’t seem prepared for this eventuality at all,
which is kind of surprising given that I personally can’t imagine any decent software
companies NOT doing this during an interview.</p>

<p>So, you’re going to have to do whiteboard coding. Accept it. The good news is that
<strong>it’s actually easier that coding on a computer</strong>. I have personally tried to out-smart
the whiteboard by bringing a laptop to an interview, thinking that doing what I
do every day would be more successful than the unnatural exercise of coding
without a feedback loop. Big mistake.</p>

<p>As a candidate, the person interviewing you should be your feedback loop. That’s what
they are really after anyway; an insight into how you think about coding. Plus, you only
have to write code that <em>looks</em> like it will work to the satisfaction of all parties
present. If you whip out a computer, the code will HAVE to be write, because you’re
going to be running it.</p>

<p>The key to keeping your composure is to practice breaking test problems down into five
stages. <em>Restate</em> the problem as they have given it to you. Come up with <em>examples</em>,
including edge cases. Work out an <em>algorithm</em> by doing the problem by hand on the
whiteboard. Only then do you write some <em>code</em>. Finally, reason out loud about the
<em>time</em> your algorithm will take to run. This is known as <strong>REACT</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="the-other-stuff">The Other Stuff</h1>

<p>Assuming you get past the technical coding portion of the interview, an additional chunk
of candidates flub what should be an easy “softer” portion of the interview. The absolute
key to this part is preparation. You’re going to be asked questions, mostly of the kind
you could guess ahead of time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tell me about yourself.</li>
  <li>Where do you want to be in 5 years?</li>
  <li>What are your greatest strengths and weaknesses?</li>
  <li>What are 5 annoying things about your favorite language and framework?</li>
  <li>Why are you looking for a job?</li>
  <li>How well do you work in a team?</li>
  <li>Tell me about a mistake you made at work.</li>
  <li>Have you ever not gotten along with a coworker?</li>
  <li>What makes you a great employee?</li>
</ul>

<p>Just don’t shoot yourself in the foot here. This isn’t the time to show your sarcastic,
cynical side. You should write out the answers to these questions ahead of time, keeping
in mind the answers an employer is going to want to hear.</p>

<p>Then, it’s time for you to ask question. In fact, don’t even wait for the official offer
to ask your own questions, just launch right in whenever you have one that’s appropriate,
or if there is any dead air time. <strong>Your primary goal as an interviewer should be to make
the other person talk, ideally even more than you are</strong>. People remember conversations more
favorably when they did more of the speaking. Plus, it leaves less time for them to grill
you.</p>

<p>Again, preparation is key here. You may be meeting up to 10 people at the company. Write
out at least 50 questions, ideally more. Think about all the processes, policies and technical
decisions you’ve seen in past jobs, and ask them about how they do those things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What technical debt are you going to be working on over the next year?</li>
  <li>How many hours did you work yesterday?</li>
  <li>Have you contributed to any open-source projects as a team?</li>
  <li>How often do you hang-out outside of work?</li>
  <li>Does your 401k provider suck as much as the rest of them?</li>
  <li>You glorious bastard, I read your book! Why did you say this on page 47?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="caveats">Caveats</h1>

<p>Although live-coding on a laptop is risky, I still recommend bringing one. Occasionally
someone will ask you to solve a problem you have actually already solved in real life. In
that case, wiping out the code and taking a look at it together could both save you a
whiteboard session, and lead to a deeper conversation.</p>
