        <p>I’ve been using a time tracking tool pretty consistently for the last year to
categorize all of my time spent at work. It started with wondering how much
time I was spending in meetings. Eventually I found that it was easier to keep
up with than I thought, so I just stuck with it. Looking back at the year, I
can see some interesting data.</p>

<h1 id="toggl">Toggl</h1>

<p>The primary tool I’ve been using is <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>. It’s a simple app that sits in you status bar and prompts you to start a timer for what you’re currently working on,
if there isn’t one running already.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I eventually settled on five primary “projects” that my time is categorized under:
meetings, coding, 1:1s, writing and other. In the end, I did end up spending more
time in meetings than doing anything else.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_year.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h2 id="othergtd-time">Other/GTD time</h2>

<p>Other eventually became just “GTD” time, which is short for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">getting things done</a>.
It’s usually the first block of time in the morning, right after I grab coffee.
It consists of processing all my todos and notes from the previous day. Some tasks
I just categorize and set a due date for. Other tasks I complete right then, if
they are quick. My time spent on this category over the course of the year was
pretty constant.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_other.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>I have a whole <a href="http://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2015/05/01/omnifocus.html">separate blog post</a> on GTD, if you want to learn more.</p>

<h2 id="writing-time">Writing time</h2>

<p>The amount of time I spend writing wiki pages, blog posts and longer emails also
stayed pretty constant over the year. If I had broken this down into blog time
and everything else, I would imagine that blogging is at most two hours a month.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_writing.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h2 id="coding-time">Coding time</h2>

<p>Coding is the area that I expected to tail off dramatically, and I was not
disappointed. This year I went from managing a team of three and being very
hands on coding, to three teams with 12 total people. In the past, I’ve noticed
that right when you get to 5 or 6 people, you basically cannot write code
anymore.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_coding.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>April was a hackathon project that I spent way to much extra time on. October
was a major release that was all hands on deck. I spent a bunch of time
doing QA type stuff that I categorized as coding. Other than that, it’s been a
very steady trend downwards.</p>

<h2 id="meetings-and-11s">Meetings and 1:1s</h2>

<p>Meeting time was somewhat steady. I see a spike in March that was a bunch of
interviews, including a potential aquihire. There is another big spike in
September, which was getting a new boss, splitting up a team and also
a bunch of late project schedule coordination meetings.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggle_meetings.png" alt="img" /></p>

<p>For one on ones, there was a steady increase as we added new team members, and
then a big spike in August as we added a few new people all at once.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/toggl_ones.png" alt="img" /></p>

<h1 id="timebox">Timebox</h1>

<p>Remember that hackathon project? I also wrote a Slack bot to categorize
meetings on my actual calendar, which is an interesting way of cross checking
my manual tracking. It’s a little hard to parse, because the bot is designed
to report on one or two weeks at time. But you can see that while overall
meeting time has gone up, I’ve actually been pretty successful at maintaining
and even increasing the amount of free time I have in blocks - time to actually
work on something substantial without interruptions.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/timebox_2017.jpeg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>In fact, my time this year was 57% free time with 267 hours in blocks of at
least 3 hours. Doesn’t sound too bad when you put it that way!</p>

<h1 id="rescuetime">RescueTime</h1>

<p>Finally, there is another fully automated time tracker that I started using
more recently called <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com">RescueTime</a>. It can give you
a breakdown of time spent by app/website. I’m spending more time in Google
Spreadsheets than in my terminal app and my code editor combined, which is
definitely a strong signal.</p>
