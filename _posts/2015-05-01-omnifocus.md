[Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) is an personal organizational system for 
keeping track of todo items, and freeing up your brain to focus. The real power of GTD is in helping you
focus. Instead of worrying that you might forget something, just capture it by writing it down in a system
that you can trust. Know that if it's captured, you will remember to do it -- or rather, that you don't have
to remember to do it. Build a daily practice to process this "Inbox" of captured todo items, and nothing will 
ever slip through the cracks again.

I recommend starting by reading the classic [GTD book](http://gettingthingsdone.com/). It's 20 years old, but 
totally agnostic of tooling. You could even use pen and paper. 


## My Daily Workflow

Personally, I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) as my digital tool for GTD. Even though I prefer open source or free tools when possible, this is one purchase that's worth every penny. You can also expense it to work.

Here is an example workflow.

## What does GTD look like, in OmniFocus?

I enter tasks to my todo "inbox" whenever I think of them. This is often done from my phone. It can be during a meeting,
while out for a walk, or while making supper. I can even tell Siri to add something "to my work todo list".

In the moment, that's it. It's not until the next work day that I will look back at these items again. I typically take 
a pass at my inbox (i.e. the new items not tied to a project) first thing in the morning. If something will take less than 
five minutes, I do it right then. Otherwise, I assign it to a project and schedule it.

During the day, in between meetings or during free time, I start completing items and checking them off. You can focus on one 
project at a time, or see just your flagged items. There is even a context feature which allows you to see tasks by physical 
location, or by who you are talking to. Using tags, there is unlimited customizability of organization. 


## Scheduling Tasks 

With email, [Inbox Zero](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/inbox-zero) means archiving or snoozing items to get to a small 
set of emails that need action. GTD applies snoozing to tasks. 

Both tasks and entire projects can be deferred into the future. You can also set hard due dates.

I use this feature to ensure that I'm making steady progress on a host of projects. Maybe on Mondays I start working on project A. I make some progress, checking off one or more tasks, and then I may defer that entire project a few days or a week into the future. It will pop back up then as a reminder to continue making progress, or defer it again.


## Repeating Tasks

Similarly, there are things I want to do every single business day. I have a "Daily" project for these items, with a project level setting to repeatedly defer them by one day every time I check off a task.

## Saying No 

Once you're confident that you're fully utilizing your heads down work time for the highest priority tasks, you can start
to confidently say no to lower priority tasks. There is no reason to feel guilty, if you're already making the most of 
you time. Similarly, you know that the right thing to do is decline "urgent" meetings, if they will get in the way of 
heads down time that's necessary to stay on top of things. 


## The Magic is the Practice 

The practice of having a dedicated time to process your inbox is the key to GTD. 
The magic happens when you start to trust that if you capture something, it will get done.
Eventually, you will level up and start to realize that it's fine to say "No" to something, or 
to get back to someone and tell them that you're not going to do a task, after all.
