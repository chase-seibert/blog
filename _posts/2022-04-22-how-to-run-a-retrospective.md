A retrospective is a team meeting following a sprint, quarter, or a specific project. The team talk about what went well, 
what didn't go well, and what they could do better. There are a good catch-all for team health, bonding, and continuous improvement. 
They give everyone on the team a forum to voice their ideas. As an engineering managers, my teams always did retrospectives every 
two weeks, at the end of a sprint. I've probably been in something like 250 retrospectives, and I ran at least three quarters of them. 

Running a retrospective is easy. If you're looking to get started as a facilitator, this blog post should get you up and running quickly. 

The Basic Formula 

The most common retrospective format is brainstorming, voting, discussion, and action items. Here is a sample agenda for a 60 minute team retrospective:

1. Write the categories "what went well", "what didn't go well", and "what we could change" on the whiteboard
2. Silent brainstorming, team members write ideas down on sticky notes (10 minutes) 
3. Team members take turns putting their stickies on the whiteboard, quickly summarizing each one (10 minutes)
4. Silent grouping into themes, for example "Testing" (5 minutes)
5. Voting on top themes, every gets 3 votes, put stickers or use a whiteboard marker to vote on a theme (5 minutes) 
6. Discuss the top 3 themes, and generate one action item per theme (25 minutes)

Variations

Most retrospectives will follow this format. To keep things interesting, the facilitator can change up the brainstorm categories. 

* Start, Stop and Continue 
* Wishes, Complaints, and Puzzles 
* Headwinds, Tailwinds, and Anchors 
* Glad, Sad, and Mad 

If you're looking for additional ideas, I recommend the book [Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Retrospectives-Making-Teams-Great/dp/0977616649). It covers not only many different brainstorming prompts, but also entirely different agendas and formats. 

Here is an example of a "sail boat" retrospective.

Here is an example of a "timeline" retrospective.

Agenda Add-ons 

If the retrospective is your only reliable, frequent whole-team meeting, you might want to include some additional agenda items.

* Reviewing the previous sprint, what was shipped, and what slipped? This can help generate ideas for the brainstorm. 
* Kudos! Go around the room and thank each other for something specific. This can help break the ice and prime individuals to share. 
* Do a light anonymous team health survey. How are you feeling from 1-10 about a few key questions. Record the scores over time. 

Tooling for Virtual Retrospectives

Most of the retrospectives I have been involved in were in-person, using sticky notes and a whiteboard. Virtually, you can replicate that experience with something like [stickies.io](https://stickies.io/). You could also use Miro, Trello, or any collaborative text editor.

- [ ] More motivation -- what you should do them, scorecard aspects 
- [ ] Need to actually DO the action items (rule #1) -- not about quantity 
- [ ] +/-/delta for the retro itself 
- [ ] Celebrate accomplishments 
- [ ] Resist the urge to steer towards particular sticks + action items 
- [ ] Focus should be on how to run faster/more efficiently 
- [ ] If the team is missing stories, that should be a focus 
- [ ] Safety check 1-5 to start
- [ ] Resource https://retromat.org/en/ 
- [ ] https://remoteretro.org 
- [ ] Common to revisit the definition of done, see other scorecard items 
- [ ] Working agreements 
- [ ] "Save that for the retro" / "bring that up at the retro" as parking lot 

"Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand."
