# Basic Manager Hygiene

- Have weekly 1:1s with all your direct reports, don’t skip them
- Run a tight meeting, keep to an agenda, send out meeting notes and action items
- Hit quarter level commits 90% of the time, prioritizing external commitments
- Commitment misses should be on the lowest priority items
- Be able to “do the math” to rationalize quarter level commits based on team velocity
- If you’re going to slip, communicate it early, for example 1/3 of the way in to a quarter


# Principles

Most of my expectations align to my three personal work principles.

## Autonomy

- Start by demonstrating that the team can reliably hit commitments
- Expect more autonomy on roadmap after that
- What will your team choose to do with that velocity?
- Don't wait for someone else to tell you the plan
- Makes sure you have alignment with product stakeholders

## Healthy Relationships

- Know ahead of time if someone on your team is at risk of attrition
- Flag any attrition risk (including yourself) early; want to know 6 weeks in advance
- Have a plan for +2 or -2 headcount. Be able to generate alternative roadmaps quickly
- I expect that stakeholder and direct report 360 feedback will show that people are working well together, have empathy for each other, and are able to resolve conflict themselves
- Create a safe environment that allows everyone to be their best selves
- If you’re blocked, especially on alignment with stakeholders, escalate quickly

## High Leverage

- Work on the most important things for the business
- Make good trade offs between technical and product work
- Set a vision that gets people excited about and committed to the work
- You need agreement from stakeholders
- Don't wait for a vision, sometimes YOU need to lead here
- Maximize reliability by mentoring engineers to flex scope, with stakeholder buy-in, in order to hit commitments
