# What is Strategy? 

We talk about strategy frequently in the context of building teams, and building products. But what does it really mean, and what is the final artifact? I was never quite sure, until I read [Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239) by Richard Rumelt. It lays out one version of what *good* strategy looks like.

> The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.

The proposed artifact is a short written document that explains the diagnosis, guiding policies, and actions in plain English. The hard parts are making the *correct* diagnosis, and communicating clearly and concisely in writing. I love this because it's prescriptive about what good looks like, and also the format. It allows you to get to the heart of the actual strategy work immediately. 

## Diagnosis

> The first step of making strategy real is figuring out the big ‘aha’ to gain sustainable competitive advantage—in other words, a significant, meaningful insight about how to win.

The book tackles strategy at the company level. The diagnosis should identify the most decisive challenge to the business, and also the cause of the challenge. It's OK if the challenge is written in terms of the business, and not as a user problem. The diagnosis simplifies the problem space down to one critical factor. 

There is no silver bullet to coming up with the right diagnosis. You might start by asking "five whys" about a few important business problems. Perhaps they will lead back to the same root issue. But in the end, picking correctly requires an intuitive leap. 

For example, Apple computer in 1997 almost went bankrupt. A simplified diagnosis of the central business challenge could have been "desktop computing is a winner-take-all market, and we came in second". 

> At the core, strategy is about focus, and most complex organizations don’t focus their resources. Instead, they pursue multiple goals at once, not concentrating enough resources to achieve a breakthrough in any of them.

At the company level, there should be one diagnosis, not many. The ideal strategy focuses resources on a small set of actions, and those actions exploit a strength, or take advantage of a weakness. 

For example, Apple's strategy in the early 2000s was to lie low, maximize margins, and invest in the next big thing. This turned out to be mobile. 

> Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles.

You should gather data and see if it backs up the diagnosis. What is a single piece of data that makes the most compelling case for the diagnosis? 

Don't be tempted to use the data to set a goal at this stage; a goal itself is not a strategy.  The diagnosis should not read like a wish, or a hope. 

Finally, the diagnosis needs to tell how the challenge will be overcome. 

## Guiding Principles 

> Good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to say no to a wide variety of actions and interests. Strategy is at least as much about what an organization does not do as it is about what it does.

Guiding principles inform how the business will make trade-offs. How will you choose between different actions? This helps make sure that the actions are coherent, together. It also allows the decision making to scale across the organization. Guiding principles are a good opportunity to maximize existing strengths. 

Example guiding principles for Apple could have been:

1. Cut expenses to increase runway 
2. Increase margins on products to double-down on high-value user base
3. Leverage design strength to build delightful experiences for the next wave 

## Actions 

> A good strategy includes a set of coherent actions. They are not “implementation” details; they are the punch in the strategy. A strategy that fails to define a variety of plausible and feasible immediate actions is missing a critical component.

Actions need to be both specific and achievable. 

Hypothetical actions for Apple in 1997 might have been:

1. Do a round of layoffs to increase cash flow
2. Convince Microsoft to throw us a lifeline 
3. Invest in R&D to be ready to catch the wave of the next big thing

# Multiple Levels: Make it a team sport 

> Strategies focus resources, energy, and attention on some objectives rather than others. Unless collective ruin is imminent, a change in strategy will make some people worse off. Hence, there will be powerful forces opposed to almost any change in strategy. This is the fate of many strategy initiatives in large organizations.

The book is short on this topic. By focusing on company level strategy, it fails to address how strategy is distributed across a company. Indeed, one of the main points is that there should be singular focus. At the same time, a large company will in fact do many things at once. It doesn't actually make sense to focus 100% of a company on one thing. In the best case, this looks like local strategies that align to the company strategy. 

In one part of the company, it make sense to ask "what does the company strategy translate to, in our world"? For the part of Apple that owns experimental R&D, this is going to be quite different to HR that owns company staffing. 

Depending on whether the customer of the organization is internal or external, it starts to make more sense to phrase the local diagnosis in terms of the customer. For example, if Apple's company strategy is to raise margins, the MacOS team may phrase it's local strategy as "As a MacOS business customer, I want more differentiated value in the product to justify a higher price". Inside a specific product team, the local strategy could be "AppleWorks needs to solve more customer problems, specifically Email, Calendaring, and Presentations". 

In this way, each organization and sub-organization can have their own strategy that aligns to the company strategy. 

There are times of year that are naturally more strategy focused. But setting strategy is something you should be doing all the time, as a leader of an organization. Instead of thinking about it like a once-a-year waterfall process, think about it more like cyclical continuous refinement. 

At the team level, the actions are going to be much more concrete than at the company level. "Increasing margins" at the company level could translate to "Add specific feature X that customers are willing to pay more for" at the team level.


# What is out of scope?

> Despite the roar of voices wanting to equate strategy with ambition, leadership, “vision,” planning, or the economic logic of competition, strategy is none of these. The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors.

There is a lot of stuff that comes *after* the strategy. It's common to refresh strategy yearly, and then do headcount planning and potentially reorganize teams. That's a complex topic, on it's own. Strategy is sometimes conflated with vision and mission, although they are actually separate. Roadmap planning in another common follow-on from strategy work. 

These should all be done after defining a strategy, for the simple reason that strategy informs what to focus on. It's true that you can't make sure a strategy is achievable without concrete actions, and eventually estimates. But, the greater risk is defining a vision and roadmap that do not address the critical business challenge.

The key stages in drafting a strategy are all around feedback. First, get feedback from your peers. You all need to be on the same page about the primary business challenge, and the most important actions. At every review, you want to answer the question, "would I fund this initiative"?

Then, get feedback from your leadership team. Ask the to be brutal. Get feedback both 1:1 ahead of time, and in a group setting. Plan to do multiple rounds of edits. Ask how this relates to other strategies. 

Finally, incorporate feedback from your organization itself. This often looks like the addition of actions that line up to the strategy. There is a danger in both communicating the strategy before you have upwards alignment, and also waiting until the strategy is locked to ask for additional actions. You need to find a balance. Give teams permission to go off and create their own strategies that line up to this.
