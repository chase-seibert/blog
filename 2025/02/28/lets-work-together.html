        <h1 id="my-journey-in-tech-and-beyond">My Journey in Tech and Beyond</h1>

<p>I started coding in middle school, messing around with BASIC and writing simple programs just for fun. But things really clicked for me after <strong>Apple World 1996</strong>, where I got into web development. Something about the web—its immediacy, its interactivity—pulled me in, and I never really looked back.</p>

<p>During college at <strong>Boston University</strong>, where I majored in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, I took on freelance projects, which turned out to be my first real exposure to building software for actual users. After graduation, I joined a tiny startup called <a href="https://www.bullhorn.com/">Bullhorn</a>—just <strong>10 people</strong> at the time. By the time I left, it had grown into a <strong>300+ person company</strong>. I wore just about every hat imaginable, from coding a <strong>custom email server</strong> to racking physical machines in a <strong>data center</strong>.</p>

<p>I took inbound customer support phone calls, troubleshooting issues and learning firsthand how users interacted with our software. I created visual design mockups, ensuring a polished and user-friendly interface. On the engineering side, I wrote full-stack features—from styling the UI with CSS to designing and implementing database schemas. I also worked with then-cutting-edge Ajax in JavaScript to create dynamic, responsive user experiences. This experience shaped my approach to problem-solving, product thinking, and building systems that balance usability with technical efficiency. That kind of early-stage chaos taught me how to build things from scratch, solve problems with whatever was on hand, and work across disciplines.</p>

<p>After Bullhorn, I moved into backend engineering, focusing on <strong>Python</strong> at two different companies. Somewhere along the way, I transitioned into <strong>full-time management</strong>, realizing that my biggest impact wasn’t just in the code I wrote—it was in <strong>helping teams function at a higher level</strong>. Managing people let me shape <strong>healthy team dynamics, excellent communication, and high-leverage work</strong>.</p>

<p>I fell in love with mentoring <strong>new engineers</strong> and <strong>first-time managers</strong>. I geeked out on things like <strong>hiring processes, promotion frameworks, tech talks, and internal blogging</strong>. As I moved into senior leadership roles, I found myself drawn to the big, messy, ambiguous problems—the ones where there’s no clear solution. Things like <strong>shifting team culture, rolling out a new process across hundreds of people, or even navigating major layoffs</strong>. Those were some of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do, but they were also deeply <strong>engaging learning experiences</strong>. The irony is, the bigger the problem, the less I can write about it!</p>

<h2 id="beyond-work">Beyond Work</h2>

<p>Outside of work, I’m into <strong>basketball</strong>, <strong>ultimate frisbee</strong>, and the occasional <strong>RPG video game</strong> binge. I’ve also developed a love for <strong>photography</strong>, <strong>gardening</strong>, <strong>personal finance</strong>, and <strong>cooking</strong>. When I’m not diving into leadership challenges, you’ll probably find me coaching Little league, reading <strong>science fiction</strong> (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9297327-chase-seibert">Goodreads profile</a>) or experimenting with a new recipe (<a href="https://chase-cookbook.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cookbook.pdf">cookbook link</a>).</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I like solving problems—whether it’s in code, teams, or life in general.</p>

<h1 id="my-working-style-profile">My Working Style Profile</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Myers-Briggs (ISTJ):</strong> Logical, structured, and detail-oriented; values stability, planning, and accuracy over spontaneity.</li>
  <li><strong>Strengths Finder (Analytical, Focus, Discipline, Futuristic, Relator):</strong> Data-driven problem solver who thrives on long-term planning, structured execution, and deep connections.</li>
  <li><strong>Enneagram (Type 8 - The Challenger):</strong> Independent and direct; challenges ideas, values autonomy, and resists control or rigid authority.</li>
  <li><strong>Insights Discovery (BRGY - Logical &amp; Independent):</strong> Strategic and objective thinker who prefers working independently and values precision.</li>
  <li><strong>BlueEQ (High Self-Confidence &amp; Resilience):</strong> Accountable, disciplined, and motivated; comfortable making tough decisions with a long-term focus.</li>
  <li><strong>My Worldview (Redefining):</strong> Challenges norms, seeks deeper understanding, and values intellectual curiosity and alternative perspectives.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="working-with-me-a-guide-to-navigating-my-precise-analytical-and-independent-thinking">Working with Me: A Guide to Navigating My Precise, Analytical, and Independent Thinking</h1>

<p>If you work with me, you’ll quickly notice a few things: I value precision, thrive on logic, and am relentless in my pursuit of clearly defining the principles behind a decision or creating a structured framework for thinking about a problem. I enjoy breaking down complex challenges into organized solutions, and I don’t make decisions based on gut feelings or emotions. Instead, I gather data, assess the facts, and execute with a methodical approach. My closest team describes me as a <em>“teddy bear wrapped in barbed wire”</em>—I can come off as intense or intimidating, but at my core, I care deeply about getting things right and supporting the people around me. If you’re looking for someone who brings stability, organization, and follow-through, I’m the person you want in your corner.</p>

<h2 id="strengths-a-strategic-no-nonsense-problem-solver">Strengths: A Strategic, No-Nonsense Problem Solver</h2>

<p>I operate with a long-term vision and high personal standards. I’m analytical, systematic, and disciplined—someone who enjoys assembling facts, structuring information, and identifying patterns. I don’t need constant check-ins to stay on track; if you give me a problem to solve, I’ll take it seriously, dig into every possible angle, and provide a well-reasoned path forward. I don’t get overly swayed by sentiment—my decision-making process is rooted in logic and practicality.</p>

<p>As a leader, I set clear expectations, delegate heavily, and take a hands-off approach, trusting my team to take ownership and drive outcomes. I value efficiency and accuracy, and I have little patience for unnecessary bureaucracy or inefficiency. My expectation is that my team always does what’s best for the company, takes full responsibility for their work, and embraces a certain level of scrappy, non-scalable effort when needed to meet leadership where they are and assume good intent. If you need honest, critical feedback, I won’t sugarcoat it—but it will always be geared toward achieving the best possible outcome. I appreciate regular 1:1s where we share notes in writing, including feedback, materials to align on, and as an external brain/memory for future reference.</p>

<p>I can count the number of people I haven’t gotten along with in a work context on fewer than five fingers. I prioritize building strong professional relationships and fostering trust and psychological safety with my peers and closest teams, which has consistently led to productive and collaborative working environments.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-work-best-with-me">How to Work Best with Me</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Be clear and factual.</strong> I respect logic and objectivity, so the best way to work with me is to present well-reasoned arguments supported by data.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t take my directness personally.</strong> My feedback is about improving the work, not a personal critique. If I challenge an idea, it’s because I want the best possible outcome.</li>
  <li><strong>Give me space to think.</strong> I’m not a fan of extemporaneous discussion—I prefer time to process before making a decision. If you need a fast response, providing key details upfront will help.</li>
  <li><strong>Be prepared to adjust plans.</strong> While I value structure and planning, projects inevitably evolve. Helping me see the strategic benefits of a shift in direction will make the transition smoother.</li>
  <li><strong>Build a working relationship over time.</strong> I work best with people I know well and trust. If we haven’t worked together before, expect to invest if really getting to know each other before we hit full stride.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, I’m the kind of person you want leading a critical project, managing complex problems, and ensuring follow-through on key initiatives. I’m analytical, disciplined, and strategic—but also independent and structured in ways that may require adaptation from teammates who operate with a more fluid, emotionally driven approach. If we align on expectations and approach work with clarity and purpose, I’ll be a reliable and effective collaborator.</p>
