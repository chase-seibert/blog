Organization Design is optimzing for a few different dimensions: accoutability (people), ownership (code), and dependencies (collaboration). 
No perfect org design, will change on a regular basis 
Not just about teams + themes, ALSO about accountability rolling up
Maxim about shipping your org structure -- you get to choose what you ship 
Common for the pendulum to swing back and forth 

Accoutability
- People (overall DRI, sub-initiative DRIs)
- Prioritizes innovation 
- Who reports to who is a key lever for ongoing alignment 
- Best for executing a specific set of initiatives, DRIs can dicover solutions 
- Often used for product orgs
- Pros: make sure initiatives are resourced, makes product managers happy 
- Cons: changes more often, sizes are not optimal / bias to give product managers equal resources 

Ownership
- Code is broken up into services, codebases, modules
- Prioritizes quality 
- This is shipping your org structure 
- Best for keeping things running 
- Often used for platform orgs 
- Pros: changes less often, makes engineers happy, easier to figure out who owns an bug 
- Cons: bias to unwarrented investment in low impact work, accountability and execution harder

Dependencies 
- Collaboration, required for most things in a large org, minimize collaboration across reporting lines
- Prioritizes execution
- Dependencies kill, #1 reason for initiatives failing 
- Best for one big top-priority mega project 
- Pros: minimize risk to project
- Cons: the project is often over-staffed / scope creep, changes often 

Matrixed
- Can't optimize for all dimension; some dimension will be marixed 
- Only commonly discussion when it's reporting strucure being matrixed 



# Objective 

## Pros

- Sure to staff the initiatives 
- Lines up reporting structure to initiatives for status + DRIs driving those
- 

## Cons

- Swimlanes may not be clear
- May result in lots of ownership changes 
- Easy to forget about KTLO

Organizational Design

I have a clear succession plan, and build a strong bench that sets my team up for success in the future for key roles on my team with a long-term view
I invest in developing a pipeline of future leaders for Dropbox
I help prioritize, and structure the engineering organization to successfully execute against a portfolio of investments
I ensure projects are staffed appropriately to set them up for success, placing my strongest technical leaders where they are the most needed and impactful
