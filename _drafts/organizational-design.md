You can optimize for Objectives or Ownership
No perfect org design, will change on a regular basis 
Not just about teams + themes, ALSO about accountability rolling up

# Objective 

## Pros

- Sure to staff the initiatives 
- Lines up reporting structure to initiatives for status + DRIs driving those
- 

## Cons

- Swimlanes may not be clear
- May result in lots of ownership changes 
- Easy to forget about KTLO

Organizational Design

I have a clear succession plan, and build a strong bench that sets my team up for success in the future for key roles on my team with a long-term view
I invest in developing a pipeline of future leaders for Dropbox
I help prioritize, and structure the engineering organization to successfully execute against a portfolio of investments
I ensure projects are staffed appropriately to set them up for success, placing my strongest technical leaders where they are the most needed and impactful
