Story time: early career, first engineer, 360 feedback that folks didn't want to work with me, especially cross-functional folks. "Cocky". Manager got some quotes from peers. Formative. The lesson was I had a lot of growing to do on the soft skills side. Impact was overall effectiveness. Realized that internal credibility had hit a ceiling, and that it would be tough to change. Took 5 years ;)

Crossing into unhealthy is a combination of frequency, and severity. It’s ok to complain sometimes. It's like a diet. You can’t go wrong in terms of fostering healthy relationships by taking extreme ownership, assuming good intent, and radiating positivity. Expect more as you get more senior. 

# Expectations for Senior Folks 
Expect excellent feedback, your direct reports and peers. Level where I ask you a direct reports how they feel about working with you. 
There will very likely be anonymous surveys that score you as a manager.
I expect that when you’re dealing with other teams, across the organization, that you’re representing both your team and your leader ship team well.
I expect you demonstrate that you trust you and that today despite trust in you. 
Team check ins with your leads, expect peers to be not contradicting each other, you need to be on the same page.
I expect him ever get exclusive reports of negative feedback about interactions with you whether they’re written or verbal
Expect that someone leaving does not cite their manager as the cause, with the possible exception of performance management 

For managers, recap and reframe w/ direct reports 

# Common Stressors on Health Relationships 

## Blockers 
Healthy relationship doesn’t mean nothing ever goes wrong
Of course, I expect you to bring up walking issues both to me directly and to your leads as a group
Never come from the position that there is nothing you can do that’s under your control.
If you have a potential solution propose it. Oh goodness motions like your hands green lighting something you think solves the blocker. 
Of course it’s OK to bring up blockers without having a solution
Assume good intent, ask open, ended questions, keep the tone positive
Blockers about uncertainty in particular may not be resolved in a timely fashion
It’s OK to ask whether you can expect your boss with resolve a blocker, and clarify whether it’s their responsibility. Don’t assume. 

## Uncertainty 
The level of uncertainty and ambiguity you encounter and deal with on a regular basis, is only going to increase as your seniority and scope increases
At a certain level, no amount of uncertainty around acuity is anomalous or outside the range of expectations for your role
Uncertainty is not an excuse for unhealthy relationships or interactions
Escalations should be healthy 

## Lack of Confidence 
What if you don’t trust that someone will perform their role?
Coach them
Give them feedback
Give their manager feedback, either through me or directly
I expect the working relationship never suffers. I expect you to have relationships even with someone under performing, and then it doesn’t come on blocker for the work. 
Whether a cross function peer, your boss, or anyone outside your org is performing well in their role is not your decision — you cannot make that determination unilaterally with the information you have. Don’t assume you know what is expected of them outside the context of your roles and responsibilities with each other. It’s a good idea to make roles and responsibilities clear with key relationships. 
Specifically, we should not be barking at performing our own rules, based on our own evaluation about whether someone else is performing, there’s
A specific case that I’ve seen a lot is refusing to estimate or put work onto the roadmap if an engineering manager is not happy with either a product spec or a design mock
There are normal and healthy ways to refine scope as a team, that do not look like taking your ball and going home

### Example: All Hands Q&A (uncertainty AND lack of confidence)
Particular bad pattern I’ve seen 
Even if a question is anonymous, make sure it comes across with good intent
Avoid stating assumptions as facts 
Time should be positive 
Asking a hard question is not valuable enough to warrant a negative tone 
Being right, or being honest does not absolve you from accountability for how you are perceived 
Your ratio of spicy questions matters — you don’t want to be the person everyone knows will be throwing bombs 
Seeing that your typing a question should not make your leads nervous 


# How to Optimize for Health Relationships 

## Tone and Positivity
It’s up to you to radiate the positivity and then you would want to see in anyone 
Relentlessly assume good intent 
Psychological safety is a two way street. Part of tailoring communication is leaving the door open for constructive discussion. A culture of feedback doesn’t absolve people from accountability for how they communicate.  
Feedback with frustrated or entitled elements should go through me 1:1. I encourage everyone to reach out directly to others leaders across the org, but you’re responsible for how your feedback is perceived. 
Praise in public, criticize in private applies to all audiences, not just your reports. 

## Optimize Team and Company 
We are all accountable for the entire organization under us, being reasonably happy, engaged, and retentive 
That does not mean that we are optimizing for engineers, being happy over the team or the company being successful 
Specifically, managers at all levels should be optimizing for what is best for the company not what is strictly best for a team or an individual 
Part of the managers responsibility is maximizing team house is in any cases of Schoen in terms of continuity other teams roadmap for continuity of team membership 
People stay at jobs ultimately because they like, trust, and respect the humans around them 

## Giving feedback to your direct reports and still maintaining relationship health 
Give feedback promptly after an incident 
Use the situation behavior impacts format
Stick to the facts 
Keep the tone of the feedback neutral 
Avoid judgment phrases about whether the person is good or bad, or making assumptions about their feelings or motivations 
Sometimes damaging the relationship is unavoidable, but I expect it to always be professional 

# Conclusion
Story time. Getting fired at NerdWallet. Results were great. Peer, team and direct lead relationships were great.  It I pissed off my bosses bosses boss, and that was it. No warning, no feedback. Not even sure what happened, but I can guess. Came down to a refusal to engage, balked at moving forward with a project that didn’t have key personnel that I judged was required. Gave them direct feedback, but tone was this is crazy / unreasonable / you need to solve this. Later, there was a misunderstanding about who shared internal transfer information — but my credibility with them was shot. I had burned trust instead of taken responsibility, and that was unrecoverable. 

Outside layoffs, attitude and unhealthy relationships is tied with actual performance issues for cases where people were fired 
Sometimes you can do enough damage to your internal reputation that it’s impossible to recover — there is no PIP
for that case 
Inability to constructively collaborate with a cross function peer is potentially grounds for not meeting expectations all by itself
