        <p>At my last job, I learned what it really means to be a manager. For the first time, I managed other managers, and I had to build a team by hiring. I’ve added those things to my resume. But I also picked up little points of wisdom along the way. Those were even more valuable. Here are my key takeaways:</p>

<h2 id="pivots-are-hard">Pivots Are Hard</h2>

<p>The term “pivot” is used when a company changes its business model. Specifically, I was pitched on helping the company transform from a content/SEO focus to a product focus. My teams built the company’s first non-content products.</p>

<p>This process was extremely painful. Three years later, even getting on the same page about what being a product meant was still an ongoing discussion. Basic concepts such as user engagement, what a product manager is, and engineering as a value center were still not universally well understood.</p>

<p><strong>Learning: Non-product-oriented companies cannot become product-oriented without a LOT of pain.</strong></p>

<h2 id="c-level-reporting-structure-matters">C-Level Reporting Structure Matters</h2>

<p>I did not fully understand the impact of the company being a “matrixed” organization. This turned out to mean that the company was split into many sub-organizations. Each one operated with independent leadership and engineering teams. In practice, it also meant that the various groups often worked against each other instead of with each other.</p>

<p>As part of the product pivot, all the groups, including a unified engineering organization, were put under a CPO (Chief Product Officer). This produced a gap in how engineering was perceived. Instead of seeking to understand how engineering could be empowered, the company attempted to tell engineers what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Learning: For engineering to be properly valued, it needs to report up exclusively through engineering leaders all the way to the CEO.</strong></p>

<h2 id="trust-your-business-instincts">Trust Your Business Instincts</h2>

<p>I probably should have learned this lesson previously. As engineers, we have a tendency to abdicate serious thinking about business problems to business experts. But twice now, I’ve seen that I should trust myself more.</p>

<p>Once before, the red flag was a reliance on Facebook as a partner. This time, it was a reliance on Google and SEO. In both cases, those risks actually materialized into large negative impacts on the business. When you identify a red flag for the business, go into your role clear-eyed about that risk. People you interview with will have polished, buttoned-up answers to these concerns. Remember that they have had months or years to polish those answers! You are smart; don’t discount your intuition.</p>

<p><strong>Learning: Take seriously any business risks you can self-identify while interviewing at a company. Don’t let anyone, even a founder, talk you out of your concern.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tactical-stuff">Tactical Stuff</h2>

<p>Finally, here are some smaller, more tactical items I will take with me going forward.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The biggest reason projects fail is <strong>lack of alignment</strong> with upper management. You need to continuously realign.</li>
  <li>Treat performance reviews as a year-round job. You should have a <strong>living draft of reviews</strong> for all your direct reports and regularly talk about the feedback with them. This is especially important if layoffs occur unexpectedly: you don’t want to add to the surprises.</li>
  <li><strong>Be flexible</strong> about team composition. You don’t have to create the ideal team right away, especially if there isn’t alignment with leadership.</li>
  <li>In the face of ambiguity, a bias toward action should be tempered somewhat with <strong>seeking first to understand</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you can’t sit down for a one-on-one with a high-level stakeholder, at least <strong>try to put yourself in their shoes</strong>.</li>
  <li>Set expectations of <strong>confidentiality</strong> around personnel moves. Specifically when moving people between teams and when people are leaving the company, make sure anyone who does know ahead of time keeps it under their hat.</li>
  <li>Be careful about executing a <strong>succession plan</strong> for yourself without knowing what your next role will be. Always do the right thing for the company, but you may be moved quickly into a new role that you’re not as excited about.</li>
  <li>Identifying a problem is not enough. You also need to <strong>propose a solution</strong>. Otherwise, it’s just complaining.</li>
  <li>Think about who to CC on email outside your direct group. Any email that you send above your boss in the reporting chain should also include them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>What I really learned was that in a management role, you need to think a lot more about the big picture. You need to think about not just the business fundamentals, but also the the highest level stakeholders.</p>
